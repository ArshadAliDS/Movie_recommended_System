# Movie Recommendation System

This repository contains a project focused on building a movie recommendation system that provides personalized movie suggestions based on user preferences. The system leverages both collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to deliver accurate recommendations.

## Project Overview

The movie recommendation system is designed to suggest movies that align with users' tastes. By analyzing past user interactions and the features of movies, the system predicts what movies a user is likely to enjoy.

### Dataset

The project utilizes a dataset that includes movie ratings, user information, and metadata related to the movies (such as genres, release year, etc.). Commonly used datasets for such projects include the MovieLens dataset.

## Methodology

The recommendation system combines several approaches:

### Collaborative Filtering

1. **User-based Collaborative Filtering:** Recommends movies that similar users have liked.
2. **Item-based Collaborative Filtering:** Recommends movies similar to those the user has liked in the past.

### Content-based Filtering

- Analyzes the characteristics of movies that the user has rated highly in the past (e.g., genres, directors, actors) to recommend similar movies.

### Hybrid Approach

- Combines collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to improve recommendation accuracy by leveraging the strengths of both methods.

## Key Features

- **Personalized Recommendations:** Tailored movie suggestions for each user.
- **Scalability:** Can handle large datasets, accommodating millions of users and movies.
- **Hybrid Filtering:** Enhanced accuracy by combining multiple recommendation techniques.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core language for developing the recommendation algorithms.
- **Pandas and NumPy**: For data manipulation and numerical computations.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Used to implement machine learning algorithms.
- **Surprise Library**: For building and evaluating collaborative filtering models.
- **Stremelit**: Web framework for creating the application interface.
